# Overview of Data Engineering Ecosystem

Data engineers ecosystem includes infrastructure to
  * extract
  * architecting and managing pipelines and data repositories
  * optimize workflow and data flow
  * developing applications needed

Data can be categorized into
  * structured (follows format and in rows and columns)
  * semi-structured (consistent but not rigid)
  * unstructured (complex and qualitative)

Types of data repositories
  * transactional (OLTP), store high volume of data, mostly relational
  * analytical (OLAP), relation or non-relational, data warehouses/lakes

Collated -> Processed -> Cleansed -> Integrated -> Users

Data pipeline is a set of tools and processes of data from source to destination
(ETL or ELT)

BI and reporting tools present integrated data in a visual format in a drag and
drop manner
