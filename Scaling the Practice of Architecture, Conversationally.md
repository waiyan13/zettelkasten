# Scaling the Practice of Architecture, Conversationally

:technical_leadership:

In current continuous delivery environment, "traditional" architect's role
breaks down due to the nature of high autonomy.

Archiects have to think about how they can be present and impact decisions in
highly autonomous teams.

One solution is to conduct via the "Advice Process". Every member of the
localized team can decide on architecture but beforehand, they must consult two
groups of people.

One is people who are highly affected by it. The other group is people with
expertise in the decision area. The decision maker must get advice from those
groups and record those.

Sometimes there are so many people to talk to due to the size of the decision
to be taken. Having a checklist helps to select who to speak to. This also
helps in thinking about the size and impact of the decision and adjust
accordingly.

When choosing people to get advice, go to people who will disagree to get
different insights and to avoid bias.

It is the architecture in the head of the developer that gets to production. By
making the developer in making architecture decisions, the risk of implementing
wrong or different architecture is reduced.

If everyone is making archiecture decisions in their own group, how will
architects make sure the whole thing is coherent?

Conversations are at forefront to make the Advice Process smooth sailing. Those
conversations exist in the form of four elements supporting the process.

## A thinking and Recording Tool

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) includes:

- title (a unique identifier with the decision itself)
- status (`Draft`, `Proposed`, `Adopted`, `Superseded`, `Retired`)
- decision (summary of the decision)
- context (conditions for the decision to be taken)
- options considered (brief pros and cons for other options)
- consequences (positive and negative impacts of the decision)
- advice (record all given advice, with name of advice give and date)

ADR helps teams learn how to make architecture decisions as a thinking
checklist to think and have conversations
