# Unix Philosophy

:design_philosophy:

Unix philosophy is based on practical experience with a bottom-up approach, not
top-down from academic findings.

Each program does one thing. For a different purpose, build a new one instead of
adding to the existing program.

Expect the output of a program to become the input of another unknown program.
Don't put unnecessary information in output. Avoid output as binary and
interactive outputs.

Design, build and iterate early and often. Don't hesitate to throw out unfitting
code and start anew.

Prefer tooling over unskilled help. Build tools to solve problems even if you
have to throw them out after the problems no longer exists.

Don't optimize until you find the bottleneck because you will never know where
it will occur.

Measure before you implement optimization.

Don't jump to efficient but complex algorithms until the problem size is big
enough. Complex algorithms are slow when the size is small.

Simple over complex (algorithms and data structures wise).

Data structures over algorithms in solving problems. For right data structures,
the right algorithms are pretty obvious.

Rule of Modularity      - Simple parts connected by clean interfaces
Rule of Clarity         - Clarity over cleverness
Rule of Composition     - Programs connected to other programs
Rule of Separation      - Policy from mechanism, Interface from engines
Rule of Simplicity      - Add complexity only when you must
Rule of Parsimony       - Only write big programs only when proven the necessity
Rule of Transparency    - Easy to make inspection and debugging
Rule of Robustness      - Where transparency meets simplicity
Rule of Representation  - Fold knowledge into data for robustness
Rule of Least Surprise  - Least surprising interfaces
Rule of Silence         - Say nothing when nothing
Rule of Repair          - Fail loud and as soon as possible
Rule of Economy         - Programmer time over machine time
Rule of Generation      - Write programs to write programs
Rule of Optimization    - Get it working before optimizing
Rule of Diversity       - There is more than one way to do things
Rule of Extensibility   - Design for future
