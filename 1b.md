# Iteration

> Iteration time is the amount of time it takes to see the change in code working
as expected.

Empowering developers to quickly experiment and learn how the code works by the
means of faster debugging and feedback time is important.

Unit tests remove the anxiety of breaking code written by someone else.

We should be asking every day how to make the process faster besides providing
business value with the current methods.
