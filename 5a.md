# JavaScript Inheritance

JavaScript only has objects with private property called `prototype` linked to
another object which is *the prototype* of said object. That prototype also has
its own prototype object all the way until the final reference of `null`.

All JavaScript objects are instances of `Object` object under `null`.

JavaScript objects are dynamic *bags* of properties. When looking for a property
of an object, it will be searched not only in the original object but also in
its prototype object and subsequent ancestor prototype objects. The property is
undefined if it is found along the prototype chain.

`func.prototype` is used to assign `[[PROTOTYPE]]`` to all instances created by
the function as a constructor.

`Object.prototype` represents the `Object` prototype object.


*Property shadowing* is when an object uses its own property while inheriting
another object with the property of the same name as prototype.

For inherited functions, it's the same as method overriding in OOP. When
executing such functions, `this` refers to the object inheriting the function,
not the prototype.

Arrow function does not have default `prototype` property.

Creating objects can be done with
  * Syntax constructs
  * Constructor
  * `Object.create`
  * `class` keyword

Lookup times on properties up in prototype chain will take longer and searching
for non existent properties will traverse the full prototype chain.

When iterating over properties of an object, every enumerable property in
prototype chain will be enumerated. To prevent that `hasOwnProperty` method is
required.

## Extending prototype chain

*Monkey Patching* is extending `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototype
and breaks encapsulation and not recommended. To use this, the function with
prototype extended must be initialized which may put unwanted methods onto the
project. 

`Object.create` can also be used to extend.

## Syntax constructs examples

```js
/* __proto__ is Object.prototype */
const obj = { a: 1 };

/* __proto_ is Array.prototype which prototype is null */
const arr = [ "a", "b", "c" ];

function f () { return false; }
```

## Constructor

```js
function g (){
  this.h = [];
  this.i = [];
}

g.prototype.j = [];

/*
 * Has h and i as own properties because of this keyword
 * gg.__proto__ is g.prototype when new g() is executed
*/
const gg = new g();
```

## `Object.create`

```js
const a = { a : 1 };

const b = Object.create(a);

b.a = 5; //a.a remiains 1

delete b.a; //b.a is 1 again due to Inheritance
```

## `class` keyword

```js
class Polygon {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}

class Square extends Polygon {
  constructor(sideLength) {
    super(sideLength, sideLength);
  }
  
  get area() {
    return this.height * this.width;
  }
  
  set sideLength(newLength) {
    this.height = newLength;
    this.width = newLength;
  }
}

const sq = new Square(2);
```
